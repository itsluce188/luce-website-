       I was fortunate to have a happy and well-guided childhood that played a major role
        in shaping the woman I am today. Being raised in a loving, united, and joyful family 
         gave me strong values, confidence, and a sense of belonging. My upbringing was filled
          with laughter, support, and meaningful lessons, and growing up with cool and supportive 
          siblings made the experience even more fun and memorable. Those early years continue 
          to influence my outlook on life and the person I strive to be.
